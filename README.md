# DS210FINALPROJECT
Final Project
My project encompasses using different various metrics to understand six degrees of separation on a data set for face boook users.

I undergo the dataset through four different functions in order to get n idea of how much the data is changing across different distances.

I push my data through a breath-first-search algorithm to assign certain distances showing the number of edges between one node and other nodes in an adjancency matrix.
